## About me
<li></li>
I'm a Software Engineer(Devops and Back-End) at Gameria.tv. Since studying in school, I have programmed in various fields. Such as web programming (front-end and back-end), embedded system (Arduino) and image processing (MATLAB). My favorite language in the last two years has been Elixir. Nowadays I love cloud computing and any kind of infrastructure work.
